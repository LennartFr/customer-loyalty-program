# How it all started

October 2008 It all started with Satoshi Nakamoto and his paper <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"> A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</a> which addressed a key problem in electronic commerce:
<h3>
<b> 
 
~~~
A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments
to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial 
institution. 

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost 
if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.

We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.

## Background to Blockchain, Connected Markets. <p>
Networks connect participants: customers, suppliers, banks, consumers
 * <b>Markets </b> organize trades: Public and private markets
 * Value comes from <b>assets</b>: Physical assets (house, car ...), Virtual assets (bond, patent ...), Services are also assets
 * <b>Transactions </b> exchange assets 

An asset can be tangible — a house, a car, cash,  land  —  or  intangible  like  intellectual  property,  such  as 
patents, copyrights, or branding. Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and 
cutting costs for all involved.

<p>
A blockchain is a <b>decentralized virtual ledger</b> for recording <b>transactions about assets </b> without <b>central authority</b> through a <b>distributed cryptographic protocol</b>. 
<p>
 The blockchain ledger is permissioned, it supports consensus, it has provenance, immutability and finality.

## The Blockchain Distributed Ledger

<p>
 
<b>Anything that you can make a list of, you can manage with blockchains</b> 

## Four elements characterize Blockchain

### Replicated ledger
* History of all transactions
* Append-only with immutable past
* Distributed and replicated
 
### Cryptography
* Integrity of ledger
* Authenticity of Transactions
* Privacy of Transactions
* Identity of Participants

### Consensus
* Decentralized Protocol
* Shared conrol tolerating disruption
* Transactions validated

### Business Logic
* Logic embedded in the ledger
* Executed together with transactions
* From simple "coins" to self-enforcing "smart contracts"

which combined provide a trustworthy service to a group of nodes that do not fully trust each other. 
<p>
With blockchain, several users can write entries into a block or a record of information, and a community can control how the record of information is modified and updated.
